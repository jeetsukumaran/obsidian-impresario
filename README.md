# Obsidian Impresario

You focus on the content.

The impresario will manage the production.

Simple Pandoc wrapper that sends your Obsidian notes to the show.

## Features

### Slide level processed from YAML frontmatter

I recognize that the slide level is not metadata and does not belong here.
But I wanted a way to package this data organically within the document.

### Nice templates

Currently focusing on developing only PDF's (articles etc.), Beamer presentations (PDF), and HTML presentations (reveal.js etc.).

### Pandoc processing of Obsidian (wikilink) citations!

The following formats are native Pandoc and are processed correctly:

- ``[@shannon-1948-mathematical-theory]``
- ``[@{shannon-1948-mathematical-theory}]``

These are "dead" text in Obsidian however, and in a typical note/document, I would like to augment the citation with links to the reference:

- ``[[@shannon-1948-mathematical-theory]]``
- ``[[references/s/@shannon-1948-mathematical-theory|@shannon-1948-mathematical-theory]]``
- ``[[some/path/and/filename|@shannon-1948-mathematical-theory]]``
- ``[[references/s/@shannon-1948-mathematical-theory]]``

However, the above will not be processed correctly by the default Pandoc.
The citations themselves are recognized and processed, but the link syntax cruft remains.
In combination with the built-in "`wikilinks_title_after_pipe`" extension and a bundled lua filter, this plugin solves the problem. ðŸ˜Š

Specifying a Pandoc citation token, which is a "@" character followed by the citekey ("`@cite-key`") as the title or display for an Obsidian internal link will result in the link markup elements being stripped and the citekey processed as a regular Pandoc citation.

## Development State

Working alpha.

All the output formats are supported with default options and custom tweaks.

The UI is clunky and ugly, but enough to get the job done.

Settings/ options/ customizations of planned.

### Issues/limitations

#### Application path

Sometimes paths in my `.bashrc` get added to the shell that spawns, sometimes they do not.
If Impresario cannot find pandoc, either set the path to the program in the Settings explicitly, or link or otherwise place the Pandoc executable on one of the system default paths.


#### Link parsing

The link needs to be separated from surrounding text by spaces to be seen by `wikilinks_title_after_pipe`:

This works:

```
[[discovery/sources/references/s/sole2000|@sole2000]] : Signs of life: how complexity pervades biology
```

But this fails:

```
[[discovery/sources/references/s/sole2000|@sole2000]]: Signs of life: how complexity pervades biology
```
